##Project Description##
The project is an exercise in getting and cleaning data. The data for this project is the acceleration and gyroscopic data generated by 30 subjects (e.g. participants) performing 6 activities. The goal of the project is to produce a tidy dataset containing the average for each mean and standard deviation measurement for each subject, activity pair. The data for this project can be found at:
<https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip>.

##Information about the Raw Data##
The link above will download a .zip file. In that file there are README and feature_info text files that describe the raw data. These are summarized below:

Measurements (also referred to as 'featuers') were taken on 30 subjects (i.e. participants) within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each subject performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, the 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity were captured at a constant rate of 50Hz. The raw dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The features/measurements selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals)

**For the raw data, the units used for the accelerations (total and body) are 'g's (gravity of earth -> 9.80665 m/seg2) and the gyroscope units are rad/seg. However, all of the features/measurements are normalized and bounded within [-1,1], thus eliminating the unit of measure.**

**For more information see the "README.txt" and "features_info.txt" files that accompany the raw data.** 

##Creating the Tidy Dataset##
The "run_analysis.R" script starts with the raw files downloaded form the link above and outputs the tidy dataset. The high-level transformation from raw to tidy data is as follows:

1. Build the "train"  and "test" datasets from the subject, activity, and features/measurements data.

2. Merge "train" and "test" datasets together.

3. Replace the numeric 1-6 values for the "activity" with its string description.

4. Extract only the mean and standard deviation variables. This does not include meanFreq variables, which are related to the mean frequency sampling of the variable - not the mean of the variable itself.

5. Rename the measurement names to make them easier to read and more intuitive. General variable name formatting is 'variable-measurement-direction' except for angle variables which consist soley of the variable name.

6. From the data set in step 4, output a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. The output file generated by "run_analysis.R" is called "tidydataset.txt". The column names are then reformatted to indicate the mean() has been taken for each variable.

**The six steps above are described in excruciating detail in the "README.md" file in this repo.**

The formatting of the variables has been standardized. All variables are encapulsated in Mean() since the mean value was taken for each variable for each subject, activity pair. The general variable formatting name is 'domain-variable-measurement-direction'. A breakdown of each component is as follows:

* domain: Either 't' or 'f' depending on time or frequency domain (via Fast Fourier Transform).

* variable: Contains several parts:
    * 'Body' or 'Gravity' signal
    * 'Acc' (for acceleration) or 'Gyro' (for gyroscope) signal
    * 'Jerk' signal or calculation of the 'Mag' (for magnitude) of the three-dimensional signal using the Euclidean norm.

* measurement: Either 'Mean', 'MeanFreq', or 'StD'. Represents the mean or standard deviation.

* direction: Either 'X', 'Y', or 'Z'. Represents the axial direction of variable.
